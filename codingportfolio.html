<h4>June 12th, 2018</h4>
<p>Today, I learned how create a separate css file for my web page. We created a new file and titled it "myStyle.css" and moved over all the style information. Then, I learned how to keep the style by linking the css file in the html files. I also learned how to "push" my GitHub to keep information updated.</p>

<p>I made so many changes to my website today! I learned how to add gifs to my website and how it's just like adding pictures. I also opened up a JavaScript file today and learned to place everything under script within that section. I had some trouble at first but managed to add 3 functions to my about page. </p>
